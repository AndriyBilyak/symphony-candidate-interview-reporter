  <h1>Before you start</h1>

  <p>Remember this:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>When interviewing you represent your company - candidates will often judge the company based on their interviewing experience</li>
    <li>Remember that an interview is a two-way evaluation process - candidate is evaluating you and your company</li>
    <li>You're evaluating a candidate against a benchmark, not comparing them to yourself</li>
    <li>Do everyhting in your power to make the candidate comfortable. Don't get too familiar with them, but don't be too cold niether - there's a balanced polite professional stance that works well</li>
    <li>What they DO know is just as important as what they DON'T - there's no single cirriculum in web development</li>
    <li>Don't get too hung up on terminology. If you sense weakness - establish it's extent, make a note and move on. Don't be a bully</li>
    <li>Be honest, avoid duplicity, don't be arrogant, opinionated or insultive</li>
    <li>Give them a chance to tell you about something that you didn't think of asking. Maybe they know Scala or Haskell ;)</li>
    <li>Try a combination of theory questions, abstract thinking (computing problems, open-ended creative problems) and a bit of practice. Get them to write a bit of code if you can</li>
    <li>The best thing you could do (which is also impractical) is to let the candidate shadow you during your typical working day</li>
  </ul>
